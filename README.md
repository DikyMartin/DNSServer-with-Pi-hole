# Building a Pi-hole DNS Server for Network Security

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up a **DNS server with Pi-hole** on Debian 11 using VirtualBox.  
The purpose of this setup is to **increase network security** and **improve privacy** by blocking ads, malware, trackers, and unwanted websites at the DNS level.  

Unlike browser-based ad blockers, Pi-hole works on the **entire network**, so every device connected to your network will benefit from DNS filtering automatically.

## 🚀 Features
- **Ad & Tracker Blocking** → Block advertisements and tracking domains across all devices.  
- **DNS Sinkhole Technology** → Prevent connections to malicious or unwanted websites.  
- **Flexible Deployment** → Works on Raspberry Pi, Debian/Ubuntu servers, Fedora, or CentOS.  
- **Low Resource Usage** → Can run on small devices or virtual machines with minimal specs.  
- **Web Admin Dashboard** → Manage blacklists, whitelists, and monitor DNS queries in real time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Operating System**: Debian 11 (installed via VirtualBox)  
- **Core Service**: Pi-hole  
- **Virtualization**: Oracle VirtualBox  
- **Networking**:
  - Adapter 1: **NAT** (for internet access, DHCP enabled)  
  - Adapter 2: **Host-Only Adapter** (for internal network, static IP `192.168.100.1`)

## 📖 Installation Guide

### 1. Update and clean system
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt clean
2. Install Pi-hole
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
If installation fails, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | sudo PIHOLE_SKIP_OS_CHECK=true bash
3. Set Admin Password
bash
Copy
Edit
pihole -a -p
⚙️ Configuration Notes
Select enp0s8 as the network adapter (Host-Only, static IP).

Recommended DNS: quad9 (filtered, DNSSEC).

Static IP configuration:

192.168.100.1 with range 10 - 50.

🌐 Accessing the Admin Panel
After installation, open a browser and go to:

🎯 Use Cases
Students learning networking & Linux server administration.

Small businesses seeking affordable network ad-blocking.

Home users who want family-wide privacy protection.

Educators teaching DNS and network security.

🔮 Future Improvements
Integrate Pi-hole with Unbound for recursive DNS.

Enable DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) for encrypted DNS queries.

Deploy on Raspberry Pi for 24/7 filtering.

Automate deployment with Ansible or Docker.
